###Deployment Steps

1. Test application
2. Optimization of code - lazy loading concept
3. Build App: script that parse, transform and optimize code
4. Upload App to a server
5. Configure server to ensure app is served securely

_Lazy Loading_: load code only when it's needed

- when application starts every import should be resolved, this delays the loading

- Lazy loading will delay the load of some content until the user goes to where the content lives, like a page
